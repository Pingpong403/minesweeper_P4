# My Minesweeper

This project started as a simple minesweeper clone. It has just about all the functionality you need for a barebones minesweeper.
<br>
The first cell you click will be guaranteed to have no mines in the 3x3 square around it. Right click to place/remove a flag, and left click to reveal a cell.
<br>
For additional functionality, you can click a revealed cell with the correct number of flags around it to auto-reveal hidden cells around it.

## Future Plans

- Since I did not plan the project before creating it, it has all the hallmarks of bad design - poor efficiency, myriad redundancies, and code where it doesn't exactly
belong. I plan to <b>completely refactor most parts of it to address these issues</b>.
- Having my own code for a base Minesweeper means I can tweak it however I want. However, in order to do that, I would first need to make everything customizable.
The next step is to <b>bring my code up to "data-driven" levels of malleablility</b>.
- Once my code is completely data-driven, I want to <b>add multiple variants players can choose from</b>.
